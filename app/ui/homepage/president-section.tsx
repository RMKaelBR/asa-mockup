        <h3>PRESIDENT&aposS MESSAGE</h3>
        <p>Dear colleagues,</p>
        <p>In the name of God, the most gracious and the most merciful!</p>
        <p>
          Before I write my message, I thought to send my gratitude to all our heroes, the MFOs, and the rest of the staff giving everything of their hearts, extraordinary dedication, and full-fledged commitment that resulted in an unprecedented performance in our history! ₱5.9 billion in net surplus is unbelievably amazing! Congratulations to everyone including our Board for their never-ending support and prayers. My heartfelt thanks to our clients, as they have given their trust and confidence to this great institution and allowed us to serve them. So, the success of ASA Philippines is the success of the clients. “Nanays, you are truly the owners of this company.”
        </p>
        <p>
          During the years 2020 and 2021, we struggled to recover our losses. By the end of 2021, ASA Philippines Foundation managed to turn around its financials.
